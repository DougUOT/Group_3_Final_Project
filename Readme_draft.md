# Grouo 3 - Final Project

## Project Overview

### Welcome to our final data analytics project, the cumulative group project. This project aims to tell a cohesive story using a dataset. This project will require many skills. We will unite all that we have learned in the classroom to create an impressive data visualization app with a small team. For example, data will need to be retrieved, downloaded and prepared for analysis. We will also need to use a database like Postgres or Mongo to store our data. In addition, we will need to apply machine learning to tell our data story. This is an opportunity to make use of machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. Finally, we will need to showcase the stunning visuals we have created by creating a dashboard. We can use Tableau for this or create a custom one with JavaScript. Whichever project we select, we will use GitHub to track our progress.
Each team member will work on their unique branch. This is important for saving our most recent work and rewinding if there are errors. The team will create a presentation to share with our class. 

### Group 3 chose that the project will relate the recommendation of films based on the rating. The database will be an open-source dataset available on Movielens Dataset, containing approximately 1,000,209 movie ratings of 3,900 movies made by 6,040 Movielens users. We will start working with this dataset by building a world-cloud visualization of movie titles to build a movie recommender system.
